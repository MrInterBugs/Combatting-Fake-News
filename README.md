Combatting Fake News Using Mobile Trusted Execution Environments

This project will develop a new method for mitigating fake news on mobile devices. It will explore using mobile trusted execution environments (TEEs) to build a secure credential store for authenticating online news. TEEs allow the secure execution of sensitive code and data, even if the native operating system, e.g. Android, is rooted or otherwise compromised. TEEs are a key component of modern mobile devices for providing secure mobile payments, biometrics, and digital rights management.

The aim of the project is to build a proof-of-concept client-server architecture that allows the secure downloading and verification of online news articles in a simulated environment.
